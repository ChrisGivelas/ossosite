        	<p id="History">
				Since its inception in 1984, Osso City Lighting has proudly been one of the Durham Region’s largest purveyors of fine lighting. 
				Over a quarter of a century later, Osso City Lighting has expanded its horizons to include home accents and accent furniture. 
				We work closely with suppliers to provide you with only the highest quality items to satisfy all of your lighting and décor needs.
				</br></br>
				Marino Osso, long-time owner of Osso City Lighting, first arrived in Canada 1966, at the age of nineteen. 
				Being raised by two hardworking farmers inspired Marino to make an honest living, so he decided to take up a trade. 
				After obtaining his license in Electrical Construction Maintenance from George Brown College in 1972, Marino opened a contracting operation called Osso Electric Limited.
				</br></br>
				For the next 12 years, Marino worked on perfecting his craft, as well as gaining knowledge of the lighting and décor wold. 
				Developing his skills as a lighting expert and businessman gave him the confidence to sell Osso Electric in 1984, and begin a new venture known as Osso City Lighting. 
				</br></br>
				Thanks to the support that we have received from the community, Osso City Lighting is now celebrating 30+ years of customer satisfaction. 
				Our goal for the future is to continue to provide the same level of excellence that we have shown since our beginning. 
				Whether its traditional, contemporary, or anything in between, Osso City Lighting has what you need.
